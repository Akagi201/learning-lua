To accompany the presentation of the evolution of Lua at HOPL III,
here are all releases of Lua. Only the source code is included; for
documentation and other files, see the original tarballs at Lua.org.

The code has been slightly updated to compile and run with gcc 4. As a
testimony to the portability of Lua, the required changes were minimal:
just a trivial change in iolib.c before Lua 2.5. The differences between
the original code and the updated code are in DIFFS in each directory.

No attempt has been made to ensure warning-free compilations. A few,
mostly trivial, changes would be needed for that, but it is interesting
to see the number of warnings decrease to zero in later versions.

To build each release, just go its directory and type 'make'. This will
run a simple test for lua and luac (when available). To build and test
all releases, just type 'make' at the top level directory.

The simple Makefiles build Lua without any special options. For those,
see the original tarballs.

Lua 3.2 may crash when run if compiled with gcc 4. It runs fine in earlier gcc.

Enjoy!
